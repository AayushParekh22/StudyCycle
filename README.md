# StudyCycle: The Pomodoro-Inspired Study Timer

## Introduction
Welcome to StudyCycle, a simple yet effective study timer designed to boost your productivity and manage your study sessions with built-in break intervals. Drawing inspiration from the Pomodoro Technique, StudyCycle alternates between focused study periods and short breaks, helping you maintain optimal concentration and rest.

## Features
- **Study Timer**: Set your study duration and dive into your focused session without distractions.
- **Break Timer**: Automatically starts a break timer after each study period to ensure you get the rest you need.
- **Notifications**: Alerts you when a study session ends and a break begins, and vice versa, keeping you on track with your schedule.

## How It Works
1. **Set Study Duration**: Choose how long you want your study sessions to be.
2. **Start Studying**: Engage in distraction-free study time.
3. **Break Alert**: Receive a notification when it's time to take a break.
4. **Enjoy Break**: Take the opportunity to relax and rejuvenate.
5. **Study Alert**: Get notified that your break has ended and it's time to resume studying.
6. **Cycle Continues**: After the break, the study timer resets, and the cycle continues.
